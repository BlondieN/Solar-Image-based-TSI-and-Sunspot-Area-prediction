# Solar-Image-based-TSI-and-Sunspot-Area-prediction
A machine learning model to predict key indicators of solar activity from HMI solar images and associated features. The focus is on Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) perturbation and Sunspot area, two indicators that capture different aspects of the solar variability.
